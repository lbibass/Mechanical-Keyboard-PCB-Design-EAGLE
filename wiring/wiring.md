Now that you have gotten the base .sch and .brd  by running the schematic script in the schematic and the board script in the .brd file, you have to finish the wiring. You must do this in the .sch file. match up the columns to each other, as the rows have already been wired. Do note that you will have to also add a controller. You can add this after you finish wiring up the columns though. After you have finished wiring, you need to decide on a controller. [That will be the next section.](controller.md)
