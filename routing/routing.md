Now that you have finished the wiring in the schematic, it is now time for either the most difficult part of PCB design, or the easiest. It really depends on how much work you want to put into it. It is time to route the PCB.

If you have autorouter, this might be the easiest part of the project. Just hit the autoroute button in the left toolbar, choose the effort (how many times the computer tries to route the PCB), and let it go to work. It can take a little while depending on the pcb, so wait until all the jobs are completed. Pretty soon, you'll have a fully routed PCB! If you do not have autorouter, this might take a while longer. You will have to route everything manually. Good luck. You might have to use vias, a small hole in the PCB to bring traces from one side to another. Avoid crossing traces at all costs, because if you do so, the PCB will be unusable.
