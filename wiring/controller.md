Now that you have decided on a controller, you have to import the footprint into EAGLE. The libraries for the Pro Micro are easily availible and open source. If you are designing a staggered layout, you might have to have the port of the Pro Micro sticking out of the side. If you have designed an ortholinear layout this will not be necessary. Now you have to connect the rows and columns of the schematic to the pro micro. be sure to connect the pins to the correct data pins on the controller. This is still in the .sch file by the way. Unless you are installing a discreet reset switch, avoid connecting to the GND and RST pins. Generally avoid everything other than data pins. [Once you've finished the wiring in the schematic, it is time to move to the .brd file, to route the PCB.](routing.md)
