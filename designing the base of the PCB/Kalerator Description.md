Kalerator is an EAGLE script used to build a PCB for mechanical keyboards. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/skullydazed/kalerator), and the actual website is [here](https://kalerator.clueboard.co).

It is very easy to use, you just select your footprint and go from there. you can use Alps, MX, Alps + MX, and LEDs. Any sort of combination really. It hasn't been updated in a while however, so there are some issues that need to be worked out. I will talk with him to see if there could be an update.  

Please note that you will need to use the Clueboard Library from EAGLE. It can be found [here](https://github.com/skullydazed/clueboard_eagle). This is the library needed to supply the components for the PCB design. This is absolutely necessary.
